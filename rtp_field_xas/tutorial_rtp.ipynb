    "The field frequency should match the one of the electronic transition targetted. \n",
    "One can use Linear response-based approaches, for instance, the XAS_TDP module of CP2K for X-Ray frequencies. \n",

    "If one wants to trigger only one electronic transition, then the pulse should be long and smooth in the time domain so that the frequencies excited are narrowed around the targetted one. \n",
    "If the electronic transitions are largely separated in frequency or if the field polarization can be tuned to avoid some states, then the field pulse can be shorter in the time domain and so the total simulation time. \n",

    "Using the effective promoting rate $\\tau$, determined from the oscillator strength of LR-TDDFT calculations, one can determine the field amplitude once the field shape is fixed. \n",
    "The results obtained in such a perturbative hypothesis are discussed below for isolated carbon monoxide. \n",
    "\n",
    "If one wants to describe what happens beyond the perturbative regime, for instance when a full electron is promoted, then the results obtained by LR-TDDFT calculations should be used as a first guess but not as quantitative prediction. \n",
    "For instance, one can set the field amplitude so that 1 electron should be promoted by the end of the simulation using the area theorem. \n",
    "Yet, it is very likely that not a full electron will be promoted by the end of the run as the perturbative regime often fails for real systems. \n",
    "In this case, one should try many field shapes and amplitude to tackle its specific system and question! \n",
    "\n",
    "Please keep in mind that increasing the field amplitude can lead to *non-linear* effects, such as higher harmonic response. These effects can happen at the same time as the loss of the perturbative regime, or independently! One can simulate for instance second harmonic generation using an intense but short pulse within the perturbative regime, and promote a full electron with a weak and long pulse within the linear regime. \n",
